# Class-Schedule-Optimization

Imagine a school with multiple classes and subject timings where certain classes 
cannot occur simultaneously due to shared resources or teacher availability. Develop 
a Java program that generates an optimized class schedule by assigning time slots to 
classes, ensuring that no conflicting classes occur at the same time. 

• Represent the schedule information as a graph where nodes represent classes, 
and edges denote conflicting timings between classes. 

• Implement a graph coloring algorithm to assign distinct colors (time slots) to 
nodes (classes) in the graph. Ensure that adjacent nodes (classes) linked by 
edges (conflicting timings) do not share the same color (time slot) to avoid 
scheduling conflicts. 

• Display the timetable with color-coded class timings, ensuring that conflicting 
classes have different colors (non-overlapping timings). 

• Use any color names as you like.
